### PMI - Principle of Mathematics Induction

## It is a prooving technique

```
Question: Proove that sum of n natural numbers equals to (n * (n+1))/2.

Now to solve this or to proove this we use PMI.

Having Steps:

1. Base Case: It is the smallest input value for which we alrady knew the answer viz. n = 1; we know that the sum of 1 number is 1 and if we put it in the equation above mentioned then we will get the answer 1 too.

2. Assumption: Here we assume that formula works correctly for n = k;

3. Self Work: using the fact that formula works for n = k; we will try to proove that formula works for n = k+1 also.
```

Notes:

1. It is a programming + math concepts
2. Recursion is a technique using which we solve bigger problems by calculating answers of smaller subproblems. We generally denote the bigger problem as a function & some arguments and then call the same function with diff arguments denoting smaller subproblems. So we get the ans of smaller subproblems and build the ans for bigger problem.
   - Recursion is function calling itself.
   - we try to solve bigger problems using ans of smaller subproblems.
