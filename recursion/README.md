### PMI - Principle of Mathematics Induction

```
Question: Proove that sum of n natural numbers equals to (n * (n+1))/2.

Now to solve this or to proove this we use PMI.

Having Steps:

1. Base Case: It is the smallest input value for which we alrady knew the answer viz. n = 1; we know that the sum of 1 number is 1 and if we put it in the equation above mentioned then we will get the answer 1 too.

2. Assumption: Here we assume that formula works correctly for n = k;

3. Self Work: using the fact that formula works for n = k; we will try to proove that formula works for n = k+1 also.
